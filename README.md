# Your Project Title

## Description 

This repo stores the assets and information for the Horiseon home webpage. In the webpage, we can see information such as what services the company provides, the importance of such services, along with the benefits of working with the company.

Originally, the webpage, along with its corresponding stylesheet, was written using a lot of non-semantic coding. Because of that, it used a lot of duplicate code in both the style.css file and the index.html file.

Through changing the div tags in index.html to more readable semantic tags along with consolidating code in the stylesheet, the webpage is able to maintain the same functionality and the underlying code is now more readable than before.

## Installation

If you'd like to install the webpage on your local machine to checkout, please simply clone the github responsitory or download it on to your computer. Then, open the index.html file in your browser.

Optionally, you can also open the webpage in your browser by clicking on this link: [Horiseon Home Page](https://daevidvo.github.io/HTML_refactoring/)

## Usage 

To use the webpage, scroll down to read the information or use the navigation bar and select the section that you'd like to jump to.
